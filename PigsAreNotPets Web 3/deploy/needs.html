                    <h2>Pigs are herd animals</h2>
                    <p>We find that pigs do better in pairs or small groups. While a single pig can make a fine companion, when they reach maturity they can sometimes start to exhibit undesirable behavior. This rarely happens in a two-pig household. Pigs,
                        being herd animals, seem to do better when they have another pig around. Most people with two pigs report that it is easier to keep two than one. We recommend getting accustomed to your first pig then adopting a second one a short
                        time later. We can help you find the right companion for your pig as well as help you introducing two pigs together.

                    <h2>Give the pigs some space! They need it</h2>
                    <p>You can keep your pig outside during the day and allow him to sleep inside at night. While outdoors, your pig will need to be protected from the elements. Provide your pig with a properly secured yard, a house with bedding (blankets or straw will do) and with an overhead shelter (above the house) like a tarp or canopy to protect him from the sun, wind and rain. If given a choice, some pigs prefer to live outdoors, so you must be prepared to provide a proper outdoor home.

                        <h2>Pigs are smart and require a lot of attention</h2>
                        <p>Having a pet pig is kind of like having a perpetual two-year old child. It is because pigs are so intelligent that they can be so stubborn, demanding and manipulative. Pigs can become easily bored, grumpy, depressed, sedentary and even destructive and aggressive, if not given adequate attention by a loving caregiver.

                            <p>It’s a common misconception that pigs can be fed anything. THEY CAN’T. Pigs thrive on a diet consisting of grain, vegetables and an occasional taste of fruit. Feeding your pig a complete feed like Champion Premium Potbellied Pig Feed supplemented with low-calorie fresh produce greens will keep your pig fit and trim. Do not feed your pig dog chow or cat chow.
