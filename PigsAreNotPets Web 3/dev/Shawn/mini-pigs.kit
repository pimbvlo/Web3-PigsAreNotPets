                <p>To keep the animals' size down, many breeders have been inbreeding and underfeeding their pigs, telling buyers that piglets are actually adults, or passing off commercial pigs originally intended for food as a smaller breed of pig. Most of these animals end up in overburdened shelters or are euthanized once they outgrow their suburban habitats.</p>
