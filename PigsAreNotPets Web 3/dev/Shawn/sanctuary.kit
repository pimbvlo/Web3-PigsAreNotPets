                <p>Unfortunately, there are few resources available for the pot-bellied pigs whose owners, for whatever reason, can no longer care for them. Many humane societies and animal control agencies consider pot-bellied pigs livestock and therefore will not accept relinquished pigs. This means that the sanctuaries, humane societies, and animal control agencies who respond to requests for assistance for pot-bellies are often overwhelmed by requests for help. And many sanctuaries, including SASHA, quickly reach their capacity and are no longer able to accept new pot-bellied pigs. </p>
