            <h2>pot-bellied myth</h2>
            <p>According to one estimate, as many as 90% of pot-bellied pigs purchased as pets are later given to sanctuaries and rescues. Despite claims from breeders and online communities, adult pot-bellied pigs can weigh between 100-300 pounds
                and have a lifespan similar to that of dogs and cats, with some living as long as 20 years.</p>
