            <p>Mrs Smith bought what she thought was a micro-pig for her daughter Emma, 26. She has now started a Facebook page: “The Truth About Micro-pigs”.</p>
            <p>“We saw a micro-pig advertised: they were small, manageable and seemed ideal for the house and garden. We were told it grew no bigger than 14 inches, but at 18 months old he’s now up to my waist. It’s difficult to cope: we have an acre-long garden, but we’ve had to pen a third of it off for Pigwig. He yearned for company, so we had to buy another pig – a kunekune pig, which will stay small. We can’t leave Pigwig alone or he’ll wreck the place, so we have to babysit him constantly. We can’t trust any animal that size with children.” </p>

            <p>In 2012, as a favor to a friend, Canadians Steve Jenkins and Derek Walter adopted a three-pound (1.4-kilogram) "mini-pig" named Esther. Or so they thought. Within two years Esther wasn't so mini. In fact, she weighed 500 pounds (227 kilograms).</p>
            <p>"We didn't want to believe it," says Jenkins, "but at four months it became painfully obvious she would be larger than we thought. She grew about three-fourths of a pound a day. And she's still growing now."</p>
