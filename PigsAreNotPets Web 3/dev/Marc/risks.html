    <h2> pig health matters.</h2>
      <p> Sick pigs can pass on zoonotic diseases to humans, which can include the skin condition erysipeloid and the bacterium Streptococcus suis, which can lead to illness including meningitis and deafness in humans. Simple actions such as washing hands and avoiding contact with animal excrement can prevent many infections, but the Government warns: "Parents and guardians should take into account the likely vulnerability of children to infection, and the difficulty in getting them to observe good hygiene practices, when deciding whether to keep any animal, including pigs. <span>SOURCE: INDEPENDENT</span> </p>

      <p> A pig has a very keen sense of smell and will be attracted to food odors on a childâ€™s hand. It is hard for some pigs to differentiate between food and fingers, unfortunately. It is dangerous to leave a young child unsupervised with a pig or any animal (and, because of their intelligence, they can be aggressive with young children). Children of any age are frequently intrigued with the idea of getting a pet pig, but quickly the responsibility of daily care falls in the hands of parents. <span>PIG PLACEMENT NETWORK</span> </p>

      <p> While the daily cost of keeping a pig is relatively low, if a pig becomes ill, vet bills can be unmanageable for some people. Qualified potbellied pig vets are unavailable in some areas. You need to locate a vet that will care for pet pigs before you bring one home. Often you will find you must travel quite some distance to find quality care. At three years old, potbellied pigs average about 125 lbs. (contrary to early advertising), making it difficult to take them to the vet in a car. <span>PIG PLACEMENT NETWORK</span></p>
