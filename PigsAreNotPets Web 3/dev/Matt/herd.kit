            <h2>Pigs are herd animals</h2>
            <p>We find that pigs do better in pairs or small groups. While a single pig can make a fine companion, when they reach maturity they can sometimes start to exhibit undesirable behavior. This rarely happens in a two-pig household. Pigs,
                being herd animals, seem to do better when they have another pig around. Most people with two pigs report that it is easier to keep two than one. We recommend getting accustomed to your first pig then adopting a second one a short
                time later. We can help you find the right companion for your pig as well as help you introducing two pigs together.
