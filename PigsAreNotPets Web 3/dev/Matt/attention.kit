        <h2>Pigs are smart and require a lot of attention</h2>
        <p>Having a pet pig is kind of like having a perpetual two-year old child. It is because pigs are so intelligent that they can be so stubborn, demanding and manipulative. Pigs can become easily bored, grumpy, depressed, sedentary and even destructive and aggressive, if not given adequate attention by a loving caregiver.</p>
