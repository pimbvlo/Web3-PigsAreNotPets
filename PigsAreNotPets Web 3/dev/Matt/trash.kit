        <h2>Pigs are not a trash can</h2>
        <p>It’s a common misconception that pigs can be fed anything. THEY CAN’T. Pigs thrive on a diet consisting of grain, vegetables and an occasional taste of fruit. Feeding your pig a complete feed like Champion Premium Potbellied Pig Feed supplemented with low-calorie fresh produce greens will keep your pig fit and trim. Do not feed your pig dog chow or cat chow.
